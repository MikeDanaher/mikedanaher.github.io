After receiving degrees in communications and economics and working in alumni relations, I quickly realized that something was missing. I always had an interest in technology, and decided to pursue a Masterâ€™s Degree in Applied Technology. With that degree, I began working as an IT Manager, maintaining hardware and building out features for a website. In my new role, I felt the most alive when writing code. Deciding to pursue software development full-time, I accepted an apprenticeship at 8th Light in March of 2014. I haven't looked back since.

I grew up on the southside of Chicago and now live in the western suburbs with my wife, Vickie, and our dog, Allie. When I'm not programming, I enjoy reading, hanging out with friends, and the occasional home improvement project.
